# SoundCloud-timestamps-D3-visualization
**ABOUT**<br>
One unique feature of SoundCloud is allowing users to post comments at specific times in a track.<br><br>
This project presents visualizations of the distribution of timestamps for comments made on particular SoundCloud tracks. It was created using the <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide">SoundCloud API</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>.<br><br>
Each circle on the graphs represents one comment, and the x-coordinate of the center of each circle corresponds to when the comment was made. Darker regions indicate at what points in a track when many comments were made.<br><br>
**CREDITS**<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> is the source of the User Content presented in this project.<br><br>
The Uploader of each track (referred to as the username in this project) is listed directly above the graph.<br><br>
Each individual graph links to the Uploader's track on the SoundCloud website. Clicking on the graph will open the track in a new tab.
